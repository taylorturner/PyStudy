# pystudy
A Python application for helping my son study for his spelling tests.

### Setup

1. Add the words you want to be quizzed on to the `words` array within `main.py`.
2. Install the prereqs and start `main.py`.
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```

### Usage

1. Click "Say the word" to listen to the pronunciation of the word.
2. Type in the word as you think it should be spelled, click "Show correct spelling".
3. Click "Clear" to clear the text box.
4. Rinse and repeat.
5. Click "Reset" to reshuffle the words and start over.

### Planned Improvements
* Enter the words through the GUI
* Modify the words through the GUI
* Add another text box for inputs that is automatically cleared
* Manage the downloaded `.mp3` files that are downloaded
* Toggle to download the files to memory instead
* Support for other languages
* Expand functionality to vocab tests and other memorization
